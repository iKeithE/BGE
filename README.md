<h1>Games Development Assignment 1</h1>

For my assignment I'm going to create an animatronic <bold>spider</bold>.
I will be using:
a cylinder for the body,
a sphere for the head an eyes
and rectangles for each of the eight legs.

<h2>Features</h2>
It will mimic the walk of a realistic spider and walk under its own power using motors to drive the legs.
It will scrunch up like a spider would when it's under threat.

<h2>Jazz Factor</h2>
I hope to make it be able to sling a web to an above surface and hoist itself up it. I will use a skinny rectangle ejected from the rear of the spider and stick to a surface in 3D space (that I will create for this purpose) and depending on the angle, hoist itself up and animate the swinging physics as it climbs.
